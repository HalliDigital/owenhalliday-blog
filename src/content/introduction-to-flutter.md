Let me guess, you love developing mobile applications, but hate the fact that you need to have multiple code bases for a single application. Also, when you make a change for one platform, it doesn't synchronise with the other and you end up running into errors.

You've tried using cross-platform frameworks such as React Native, Ionic and NativeScript, but you always have to compromise. That's where Flutter comes in.

# What is Flutter?
---
Flutter is an new and evolving cross-platform mobile development framework made by Google. It allows you to create beautiful, cross-platform mobile applications with native performance, all from one codebase.

Its support for **hot reloading** allows a developer to quickly experiment and add features with split-second reloading times. This can speed up the development progress of applications substantially, setting Flutter apart from similar frameworks.

You can learn more about hot reloading [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/hot-reload).

Flutter takes advantage of many different techniques in order to achieve high performance and productivity. These include:

- Compiling to native code
- Using widgets and only rendering them when necessary

## What kind of things can I build with Flutter?

---

Flutter is optimised to create 2D mobile apps that run on both Android and iOS. However, recent news shows that Flutter is expanding to the [web](https://medium.com/flutter-io/hummingbird-building-flutter-for-the-web-e687c2a023a8), desktop and embedded environments. In your apps, you can implement geolocation, camera, network, 3rd-party SDKs and more. 

## What IDE can I use with Flutter?
---
Flutter supports plugins for IntelliJ, VS Code and Android Studio. Android Studio provides a feature-rich environment whereas VS Code provides lightweight but functional support.

## What language is used to write Flutter Code?
---
Dart is the programming language that is used when coding Flutter applications. Dart was first shown back in October 2011, over 7 years ago.

I hope that you now understand more about Flutter, what you can build with it and more.
